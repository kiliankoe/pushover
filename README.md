# ðŸ“Œ Pushover

Simple little wrapper for the [Pushover](https://pushover.net) API. Use it to send push notifications from your tools to your or your user's devices.

## Example

WIP

## Requirements

You're going to need an API token, you can register for one [here](https://pushover.net/apps/build).

Also please read the *[Being Friendly to our API](https://pushover.net/api#friendly)* section in the Pushover API docs.

## Installation

Pushover is available through Cocoapods. To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Pushover'
```

You can also use Swift Package Manager. For that, add the following to your dependencies in your Package.swift:

```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/kiliankoe/pushover", majorVersion: 0)
```

It should also be available via Carthage/Punic, although I have not yet verified this.
