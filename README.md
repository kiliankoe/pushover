# ðŸ“Œ Pushover

Simple little wrapper for the [Pushover](https://pushover.net) API. Use it to send push notifications from your tools to your or your user's devices.

## Example

```swift
// Create a pushover object with your API token.
let pushover = Pushover(token: "<#API_TOKEN#>")

// Send a simple message directly.
try await pushover.send("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.", to: "<#USER_OR_GROUP_KEY#>")

// Use `Notification`s to use more of Pushover's features.
let notification = Notification(message: "Lorem ipsum.", to: "<#USER#>")
    .devices(["iPhone"])
    .url("https://example.com")
    .urlTitle("Dolor sit amet")
    .priority(.high)
    .sound(.intermission)

do {
    let response = try await pushover.send(notification)
    // The request might still have failed due to a wrong API token, exceeded limits or
    // other problems. Be sure to check the response value for more information.
} catch {
    // An error case means that there was a network, server or decoding error.
}
```

## Requirements
