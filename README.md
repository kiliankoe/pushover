# ðŸ“Œ Pushover

Simple little wrapper for the [Pushover](https://pushover.net) API. Use it to send push notifications from your tools to your or your user's devices.

## Example

```swift
// Create a pushover object with your API token.
let pushover = Pushover(token: "YOUR_TOKEN")

// Send a simple message directly.
pushover.send("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.", to: "USER_OR_GROUP_KEY")

// Use `Notification`s to use more of Pushover's features.
var notification = Notification(message: "Lorem ipsum.", to: "USER")
notification.devices(["iPhone"])
notification.url("https://example.com")
notification.urlTitle("Dolor sit amet")
notification.priority(.high)
notification.sound(.intermission)
pushover.send(notification)

// Use the callback to define actions based on error or success cases.
pushover.send(notification) { result in
	// A .success result case means that there were no network, server or decoding errors.
	// The request might still have failed due to a wrong API token, exceeded limits or
	// other problems. Be sure to check the response value for more information.
}
```

## Requirements

You're going to need an API token, you can register for one [here](https://pushover.net/apps/build).

Also please read the *[Being Friendly to our API](https://pushover.net/api#friendly)* section in the Pushover API docs.

## Installation

Pushover is available through Cocoapods. To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Pushover'
```

You can also use Swift Package Manager. For that, add the following to your dependencies in your Package.swift:

```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/kiliankoe/pushover", majorVersion: 0)
```

It should also be available via Carthage/Punic, although I have not yet verified this.
